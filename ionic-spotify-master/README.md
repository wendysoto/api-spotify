- Better organized in components and services, highly reusable
- Dark theme
- Support and consultation services


### Why are you doing this? (giving your time and effort for free?)
- I've been working with Ionic as my weekend projects for 4+ years (since Ionic 1). I can't tell you enough how much I love creating themes with Ionic
